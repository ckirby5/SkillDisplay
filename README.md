## SkillDisplay
A fork of the original SkillDisplay ACT overlay found here: https://github.com/Rawrington/SkillDisplay.  The original overlay was not updated with xivapi's new routes.  I have attempted to fix the routes.

## Installation
Make sure the 'Using BeforeLogLineRead' box is checked in ACTWebSocket then click the 'Add URL' button to add this URL:
`https://ckirby5.github.io/SkillDisplay/`

## Troubleshooting
This is probably very buggy and I cannot guarantee full functionality.  If anything is wrong, please reach out to me.

If you find any strange bugs, please report to me on here or find me.
