## SkillDisplay
A fork of the original SkillDisplay ACT overlay found here: https://github.com/Rawrington/SkillDisplay.  The original overlay was not updated with xivapi's new routes.  I have attempted to fix the routes.

## Installation
Add a new module to OverlayPlugin.dll via the plugins tab of ACT.  Name the module anything you'd like and choose custom.  Under the general tab of the module, enter the following URL:
`https://ckirby5.github.io/SkillDisplay/`.  Lastly, click the ACTWS tab of the module and check the ACTWS Compatibility box.

## Troubleshooting
This is probably very buggy and I cannot guarantee full functionality.  If anything is wrong, please reach out to me.
